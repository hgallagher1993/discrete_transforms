Work in progress library for Discrete Transforms such as 2D - Discrete Cosine Transform, 2D - Haar Transform etc.

The focus at the minute is to get the transform algorithms working, DCT is working and Haar will hopefully soon be 
working. When these 2 are working then I'll focus on ergonomics, error handling, more computationally efficient 
algorithms etc.
